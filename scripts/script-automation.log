Starting machine "podman-machine-default"
Waiting for VM ...

This machine is currently configured in rootless mode. If your containers
require root permissions (e.g. ports < 1024), or if you run into compatibility
issues with non-podman clients, you can switch using the following command: 

	podman machine set --rootful

API forwarding listening on: /Users/thomassuedbroecker/.local/share/containers/podman/machine/podman-machine-default/podman.sock

The system helper service is not installed; the default Docker API socket
address can't be used by podman. If you would like to install it run the
following commands:

	sudo /usr/local/Cellar/podman/4.0.3/bin/podman-mac-helper install
	podman machine stop; podman machine start

You can still connect Docker API clients by setting DOCKER_HOST using the
following command in your terminal session:

	export DOCKER_HOST='unix:///Users/thomassuedbroecker/.local/share/containers/podman/machine/podman-machine-default/podman.sock'

Machine "podman-machine-default" started successfully
